			<h2>Step 1: Reflection</h2>
			<h3>Create a document answering the following:</h3>

			<li><ul>Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?</ul></li>
			<p>I found a lot of inspiring website layouts on Pinterest and also Squarespace features a range of layout approaches for portfolios.</p>

			<li><ul>Which parts of the design are you most proud of?</ul></li>
			<p>I like the overall feel of the site created by the color palette, use of negative space, and the title / mission statement placed over the header's background image. </p>

			<li><ul>What struggles did you encounter in your design process?</ul></li>
			<p>The greatest challenge was finding the right balance between elements on the page.</p> 

			<li><ul>Which struggles did you encounter during page development?</ul></li>

			<p>It was a struggle figuring out when were good transition points for reducing the amount of columns / adjusting image sizes when making the page responsive.</p>

			<li><ul>What did you learn from making your project responsive?</ul></li>
			<p>I learned the importance of visualizing how page elements will be translated into the mobile format when you are first assembling your page layout. For example, how your group sections of content and the order you put them in are important.</p>

			<h2>Step 2: Reviews</h2>

			<h3>Review a website from group 1 and a website from group 2 of the following list, commenting on each website's layout, typography, navigation, and overall flow. </h3>

			<h4>Group 1</h4>

			<p><a href="http://www.businessoffashion.com" target="_blank">businessoffashion.com</a></p>

			<p>Home page, full browser view:</p>

			<p>The Business of Fashion logo is large, black, a distinctive design and centered on the white background of the home page. There is ample negative space around the logo to give it prominence. Below the logo there is a nav bar of relatively subtle text size, highlighted by a soft grey background. When you scroll down the page this nav bar stays fixed at the top of the screen, and the logo shrinks to the top left.</p>

			<p>Below the navigation is a two column asymmetric layout. Within the left and larger column is the main focal point of the page which is the hero image relating to the lead article. Superimposed on this image is the article's title in bold and large typeface. In the smaller and less prominent column are ads and also some additional article title links.</p>

			<p>I noticed that when scrolling down the page that the right and left columns stagger their content so that there is always something cut off at the bottom of the browser window, to encourage continued perusal of the site. The site generally flows from top to bottom and frequently zig zags between columns. Use of large pictures relating to articles are eye catching and imagery tends to be the primary use of color as a means of attracting attention on this site.</p>

			<div class="spacer"></div>

			<h4>Group 2</h4>

			<p><a href="http://cavs.mit.edu/" target="_blank">cavs.mit.edu</a></p>

			<p>Home page, full browser view:</p>

			<p>The logo, consisting of large, bold and blue stacked words, is the main focal point of this page. It is fluidly centered in the browser window and overlaps content that is in a fixed position in the background. The logo placement doesn't aid in establishing hierarchy on the page because it's not clear where the eye should travel after noticing the logo since it's sitting on directly on top of the content.</p>

			<p>The navigation is problematic because it is placed in the top left of the screen without any use of negative space to give it prominence, or sizing to make it noticeable. Also the page links aren't listed until you hover over the link, and so you have no idea what other pages might be in the site unless you happen to scroll over and realize it's the site's navigation.</p> 

			<p>There are three animated elements on the page that compete for attention.  One of them is not a link to anything and contains no information, so it serves no purpose. All the animations have rapid movement and are continuous, which makes them distracting.</p>

			<p>In terms of overall page layout there doesn't seem to be any organized approach. The content sections appear to be scattered at random over the page and the negative space is imbalanced.</p> 

			<p>The typography only varies once between the large logo / title and the remaining body text. The design makes no use of heading sizes that could help establish hierarchy. The body text is fairly small and the line height is not set for optimal readability. Also, the body text runs up against the top, left and bottom sides of the page, again reducing ease in reading the content.</p>
